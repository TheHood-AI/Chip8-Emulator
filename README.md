# Chip8-Emulator
A Chip-8 emulator built on Directx 11.
There is still a few things that I want to do with this project, like add sound. But I felt that it was 
in a good enough shape to put up here and share with people that maight be interested


# How to start
Download the Workbed folder and start up Chip8.exe

To start up a rom, press the Load button and select the game you want to load in.
There is a few roms included that you can try out, but the emulator should hopefully work with most Chip8 roms
